### Gig Description: Custom Inbound Mail Filter Implementation

---

**Project Overview:**

I implemented a robust Custom Inbound Mail Filter designed to enhance email security and integrity for business communication. Utilizing Python 3.9, AWS Lambda, and AWS Workmail, my solution meticulously scans and analyzes inbound emails to detect and flag malicious content, including suspicious words, phrases, or images.

**Key Features:**

- **Advanced Content Analysis:** Utilizes Python 3.9 to perform deep content analysis on inbound emails, effectively identifying potentially harmful or malicious content.
  
- **Seamless Integration:** Fully integrated with AWS Workmail, ensuring that the email filtering process is both seamless and efficient, without disrupting the end-user experience.
  
- **Automated Email Handling:** Employs AWS Lambda to automate the process of flagging and redirecting emails containing malicious content directly to the junk/spam box, enhancing organizational security protocols.

**Outcome:**

By implementing this Custom Inbound Mail Filter, I have significantly improved the security posture of email communications, ensuring that potentially harmful messages are swiftly identified and isolated, thereby protecting sensitive information and maintaining operational integrity.
